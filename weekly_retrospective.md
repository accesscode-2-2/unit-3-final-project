**Team Member Analysis**:
If you did not meet your goals, how will this affect the progression of the product? What will you do differently to meet your goals this week?

We met all of our goals. As a result, this gives our team time to refine the product and enhance functionality. 

**Additional Discussion Topics**:

  *  Compare your work planned with what your work completed. 
    *  We accomplished everything we sought out to complete by this demo. 
  *  Is the divison of roles within your team working?
    *  The division of roles works, but we often overlap for the sake of speed and efficiency: One person might be more familiar with a certain task.  
  *  How is communication and collaboration between team members?
    *  Communication and collaboration happens frequently. We try to work outside of class as often as possible, and keep each other abreast of any changes and potential ideas. 
  *  Are you getting adequate support? How are you reviewing code?
    * Michael Vilabrera, our mentor, regularly checks in with our team and gives us guidance on how to move forward with the project.  
  *  How can you improve productivity and get the most work done within the next week?
    *  To improve productivity we could continue having a defined list of goals to accomplish, but having more defined deadlines.
