  * Users can connect multiple devices connect via MultiPeer Connectivity 
  * Users can tell where other users are via MPC/Geolocation/Bluetooth
  * Users can TAG other users by getting close to them with their device
  * Users can tell they have been TAGGED because their device registers the TAG and responds

## Execution [SOON]
  *  A detailed timeline for building the product, broken out by weekly sprints. Think about the user stories you would frame your weeks around. *Your polished MVP (baseline features) should be ready to demo by Demo 1 on Thursday 11/17/2015.*
