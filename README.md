### Unit 3: Final Project

All apps:
  *  Will solve a relevant problem that serves an existing market
  *  Are technically complex and ambitious enough to highlight the skills you have gained
  *  Are fully functional and polished for presentation at Demo Day  

With that in mind, things to think about when ideating projects are the **technical complexity**, **design**, and **product**.

###App requirements:
*  Overall product requirements
  - Technically complex
  - Compelling use case
  - Polished implementation (UI/UX)
  - Original product 
  - An engaging pitch that connects with the audience
*  Basic technical requirements 
  - Does not crash
  - Does not hang (little or no delay visible to the user)
  - Does not fail when internet connection is slow/unavaialable
  - Have a consistent look and feel visually across the app
  - Consistent with [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH66-SW1)
  - Look great in both landscape and portrait
  - Have well-organized, high-quality code


### Tips & Ideas
*  Things that would impress:
  - Super cool library that other devs could use
  - Integration of complex APIs (e.g video, web services, etc...)
  - Awesome UI
  - Work with the OS in a more intimate way 
  - Advanced Separation of Concerns
*  Things to Avoid:
  -  Unusable: Good technical implementation, but does not consider the end user's interaction
  -  Non-function: Good UI, but does not actually incorporate the tools needed to be feature complete.
  -  Obvious: Solution can easily be found in tutorials or examples, copies an existing system tool, or simply strings together APIs.
  -  Not Useful: This app doesnâ€™t have a clear purpose or solve a problem. 
*  Some sample project ideas:
  -  Weather + Calendar
  -  Poll app / trivia app 
  -  Really good photo journal app
  -  Really good note taking app
